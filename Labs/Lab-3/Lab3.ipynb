    "# Predicting Income\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we'll be using a dataset from kaggle yet again...it's just so fun and rich! We're using the following income dataset where we want to use the other features to predict whether someone is making over $50,000 per year or not.\n",

    "Primary Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "Predict income.\n",
    "Assignment Specs:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to use Naive Bayes and neural networks in your work to answer the question above, but you should explore at least two other models in order to answer the above questions as best you can. You may use multiple neural network models if you like, but I'd encourage you to consider past model types we've discussed.\n",
    "This dataset has variables of multiple types. So, this should give you an opportunity to explore how neural networks can (or can't) handle data of different types. You may need to one-hot encode the character variables...\n",
    "Your submission should be built and written with non-experts as the target audience. All of your code should still be included, but do your best to narrate your work in accessible ways.\n",
    "Again, submit an HTML, ipynb, or Colab link. Be sure to rerun your entire notebook fresh before submitting!"
