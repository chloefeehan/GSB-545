    "You need to use at least one boosting model in your work to answer the questions above, but you should explore at least two other models in order to answer the above questions as best you can. You may use multiple boosting models if you like, but I'd encourage you to consider past model types we've discussed.\n",
    "The kaggle page indicates that the classes are extremely unbalanced in this dataset. You should keep this in mind as you work and if appropriate, take steps to adjust for it. You may need to look up how to adjust for this yourself, but I could probably make some suggestions...as a starting place check out under- and oversampling ideas described here: https://machinelearningmastery.com/tactics-to-combat-imbalanced-classes-in-your-machine-learning-dataset/Links to an external site. .\n",
