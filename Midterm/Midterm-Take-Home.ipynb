    "Your data preparation/pre-processing\n",
    "Your exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n",
    "Your modeling/ML efforts, comparisons, interpretations, and conclusions\n",
    "Your project narrative\n",
    "You should also comment (probably after the bulk of your work) on the data itself, possible sources for these data, and the possible issues that should be considered when working with this kind of survey data. \n",

    "In particular, I would encourage you to make specific criticisms of the dataset and survey as you understand them, and possibly even make suggestions for how to improve them if they were to be administered again.\n",

    "Since this dataset comes from a passenger satisfaction survey, it's important to recognize that the responses are subjective and prone to survey bias. In particular, the data likely suffers from convenience sampling because passengers may not necessarily be required to complete the survey. This introduces selection bias, as individuals who respond to satisfaction surveys typically have stronger opinions, and may be more likely to report positive experiences. This means the results may not fully represent the broader population of airline passengers, and cannot be generalized to the larger population. In addition, this data doesn't include much demographic information which can be a powerful tool for drawing conclusions about passenger behavior and identifying differences between customer segments. \n",

    "This data can help airlines capture satisfaction trends and identify areas that may need to be improved, such as service or comfort. If airlines wanted to reduce this bias, they could use random sampling or an incentive to increase response rates. Collecting more demographic data would help strengthen the analysis."
